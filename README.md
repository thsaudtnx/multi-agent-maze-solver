# multi-agent-maze-solver
Designing Intelligence Agent CW

## Overview

This project explores the efficiency of multi-agent pathfinding in grid-based mazes using Tarryâ€™s Algorithm. Multiple agents work collaboratively to navigate a dynamically generated maze, optimizing their movement through communication and sensor-based exploration. The objective is to analyze the impact of agent count and sensor length on execution time, total path length, and first solver time.

The system is implemented using Python with Pyamaze for maze generation and visualization, Matplotlib for result analysis, and Pandas for data handling.

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure you have the required Python libraries by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Simulation**
   Execute the test script to run the maze-solving simulation:
   ```
   python test.py
   ```

3. **Configure Test.py**
   Comment and Uncomment each line in test.py to run different methods. Each only one line should be uncommented in the main.
