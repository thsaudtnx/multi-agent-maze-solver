"""
Tarry's Algorithm
1) The agent should move to cells that have not been traveled by any agent.
2) If there are several such cells, the agent should choose one arbitrarily.
3) If there is no cell that has not been traveled by an agent, the agent should prefer to move to a cell that has
not been traveled by it.
4) If all the possible directions have already been traveled by the agent, or if the agent has reached a dead-end,
the agent should retreat until a cell that meets one of the previous conditions.
5) All the steps should be logged by the agent in its history.
6) When retreating, mark the cells retreated from as “dead end”.
